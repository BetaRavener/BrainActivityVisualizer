\chapter{Signal Filtering Tests}
The signal module which encompasses signal processing methods was tested against the MATLAB software to check the validity of implementation. First, a random signal with  $10000$ samples was generated. The signal was then filtered by the testing executable \textbf{sigTest.exe}. The testing executable is generated during build if the project was configured with \texttt{-DTEST\_PROJ=true}. The filtering was done in multiple configuration which are listed in table below.

\begin{table}[!h]

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}	
		\hline Filter & Window & Order & Cutoff frequency & Filename \\ 
		\hline Low-pass & Hamming & 10 & 5 & low5Hamm5 \\ 
		\hline Low-pass & Hamming & 10 & 10 & low10Hamm5 \\ 
		\hline Low-pass & Hamming & 20 & 5 & low5Hamm10 \\ 
		\hline Low-pass & Hamming & 20 & 10 & low10Hamm10 \\ 
		\hline Low-pass & Blackman & 10 & 5 & low5Black5 \\ 
		\hline Low-pass & Blackman & 10 & 10 & low10Black5 \\ 
		\hline Low-pass & Blackman & 20 & 5 & low5Black10 \\ 
		\hline Low-pass & Blackman & 20 & 10 & low10Black10 \\ 
		\hline High-pass & Hamming & 10 & 50 & high50Hamm5 \\ 
		\hline High-pass & Hamming & 10 & 100 & high100Hamm5 \\ 
		\hline High-pass & Hamming & 20 & 50 & high50Hamm10 \\ 
		\hline High-pass & Hamming & 20 & 100 & high100Hamm10 \\ 
		\hline High-pass & Blackman & 10 & 50 & high50Black5 \\ 
		\hline High-pass & Blackman & 10 & 100 & high100Black5 \\ 
		\hline High-pass & Blackman & 20 & 50 & high50Black10 \\ 
		\hline High-pass & Blackman & 20 & 100 & high100Black10 \\ 
		\hline 
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Tested filter configurations}
\end{table}

Each configuration produced single output file with the filtered signal. This file was read by a MATLAB script and compared to the result of filtering using MATLAB filters in the same configuration. The maximum and average deviation was calculated and printed to output. The difference between signals filtered by testing executable and MATLAB in all configurations was marginal and can be attributed to floating point errors.
