In order to run the application, a graphics card supporting at least OpenGL 3.3
is required. If this requirement is not met, the application will start, but all
OpenGL output windows will be black.

Controls available in chart view:
    <ctrl + scroll>     - Horizontal zoom
    <shift + scroll>    - Vertical zoom
    <alt + scroll>      - Vertical signal stretch
    
Controls available in 2D view:
    <right mouse + move>    - View panning
    <scroll>                - Zoom
    
Controls available in 3D view:
    <right mouse + move>    - View panning in X and Y axis
    <middle mouse + move>   - View panning in Z axis
    <left mouse + move>     - Rotation in X and Y axis
    <scroll>                - Zoom

To open a signal file:
    - Select <File -> Open signal file> from menu. A new dialog will appear.
    
    - Click <...> button to select a signal file. The file will be opened and
      available signals listed in the left list.
      
    - Choose signals you want to work with using the arrow buttons. You can
      choose multiple signals at once using CTRL or select range using SHIFT.
      
    - To visualize waveform in 2D or 3D view, electrodes must be assigned to
      signals. Select one signal from right list and the <Assign> button will
      become available. Select a desired electrode from the list and click the
      button. To clear assignment, use <Clear> button. Multiple signals can be
      selected in this case. To clear all assignments, use <Clear all> button.
      Button <Auto assign> can be used if the signals were named exactly the
      same as the electrodes, in which case it will pair the signals with
      electrodes automatically. The assignements can be also imported from a
      file, which was previously exported from the application.
    
    - After clicking <OK> button, the chosen signals will be displayed.
    
To redefine electrode positions:
    - Select <File -> Electrode map>.
    
    - Use <Import Map> to select an "elmap" file with new electrode positions.
    
    - Use <Import 3D Positions> to import 3D positions from an "obj" file. The
      objects with names matching the electrodes will be vertex averaged to find
      their center of mass, which will define the new position.
      
To filter a signal:
    - Select <Filter -> Basic> from menu. A new dialog will appear.
    
    - Select filter type: Lowpass or Highpass. Lowpass filter will attenuate all
      frequencies above the cutoff frequency and Highpass will attenuate all
      frequencies below that.
    
    - Select cutoff frequency.
    
    - Select filtering window. It is prefferable to use Hamming or Blackman as
      these compensate for the finitie impulse response and thus provide better
      filtering results.
      
    - Select length of the window. This is related to filter order:
      Order = 2 * Half length
